# Perk-Manager-Project
SYSC4806 Group 8 Project - Perk Management System - Milestone 2
## Project Overview

**Perk Manager** is a web-based application that helps users track and share discounts, benefits, and rewards linked to their memberships and credit cards.
**Users will be able to (when the project is done):**
- Create a **Profile** listing their memberships and cards (Air Miles, CAA, Visa, etc.).
- Post **Perks** — discounts or offers tied to a product + membership (e.g., *10% off movies with a Visa card*).
- Add **geographic** and **expiry date** limits to perks.
- **Vote** (upvote/downvote) on perks to mark them as useful or incorrect.
- **Search** for perks:
  - All users can search perks by product or membership.
  - Logged-in users see results tailored to their profile.
- Sort results by **popularity** or **expiry date**.
